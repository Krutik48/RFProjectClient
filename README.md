# Communication in a self-driving car

Our website, built using Socket.io, provides a simulation platform for facilitating communication between self-driving cars. The primary objective of this platform is to enable cars to send and receive messages, allowing them to coordinate and optimize their movements on the road.

One of the key functionalities of our website is the ability for a car to send an overtaking request to another car. When a car intends to overtake another vehicle, it can send a message through the website's interface. This message will be received by the targeted car, indicating the intention to overtake. Upon receiving the message, the targeted car can then adjust its speed to facilitate a safe and efficient overtaking maneuver.

The website serves as a virtual environment where self-driving cars can interact with each other in real-time. It provides a graphical representation of the road network and the positions of the cars involved in the simulation. The cars' positions are continuously updated based on the data received through Socket.io, ensuring an accurate depiction of their movements.

In addition to the overtaking feature, the website supports various communication capabilities. Cars can exchange information regarding their current speed, acceleration, braking, and any potential obstacles or hazards they may encounter. This communication fosters a collaborative and cooperative environment among the self-driving cars, enhancing overall traffic flow and safety.

The simulation website also includes visual indicators and notifications to provide real-time feedback to the users. For example, when a car receives an overtaking request, it can display a notification to alert the user or even trigger an automated response, such as adjusting the car's speed accordingly.

Overall, our website built with Socket.io creates a simulated environment for self-driving cars to communicate and coordinate their actions. By facilitating overtaking requests and enabling information exchange, the platform aims to improve the efficiency, safety, and cooperation among autonomous vehicles on the road.
